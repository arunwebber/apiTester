# Tabman - API Tester in a Tab

**Tabman** is a lightweight and simple API testing tool that runs directly in your browser tab. Think of it like a mini-Postman inside Chromeâ€”no installations, no heavy UI, just open a tab and start sending requests.

-----

## Features

  - **Send API Requests**: Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods.
  - **Custom Headers**: Add and edit request headers easily.
  - **Request Body Support**: Send JSON, text, or raw data with your requests.
  - **Response Viewer**: See responses formatted with syntax highlighting.
  - **Tab-Based Access**: Opens in its own tab, just like a normal web page.
  - **Lightweight & Fast**: No server-side components required, runs entirely in the browser.
